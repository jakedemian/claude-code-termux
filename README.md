# 🚀 Claude Code on Android/Termux

**Make Claude Code work flawlessly on your Android device using Termux and PRoot.**

## The Problem

Anthropic's Claude Code is powerful for developers, but it's officially only available for Desktop (macOS/Windows) and Web. **Mobile developers are excluded.**
 
Users want to:
- Develop on their phones/tablets
- Use Claude Code without a laptop
- Have a portable, always-available development environment
- Leverage their ARM64 mobile devices for actual programming

## The Solution

This repository provides **complete, tested instructions** to run Claude Code natively on Android via Termux (an open-source terminal emulator). Everything is documented, automated, and verified to work.

**What you get:**
- ✅ Full Claude Code CLI on your Android device
- ✅ Local development environment (Node.js, Python, Rust)
- ✅ MCP (Model Context Protocol) support
- ✅ Git version control
- ✅ WebSocket-based tools
- ✅ Direct system access via Bash

**Known limitations:**
- ⚠️ Some Claude Code features not yet supported on Termux (documented)
- ⚠️ Performance depends on device hardware
- ⚠️ No official Anthropic support (yet)

## Quick Start


### 1. Install Termux from F-Droid (Google Play version may have restrictions)
- Available at: https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/

### 2. Clone this repository and run the automated setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eduterre/claude-code-termux.git && cd claude-code-termux && bash scripts/install.sh
```

### 3. Verify installation
```bash
bash scripts/verify.sh
```

### 4. Use Claude Code!
```bash
claude-code --help
```

## 📱 Proof of Concept

Claude Code running **natively on Android/Termux** - Not theoretical, but actually working:

![Termux Environment Verification](screenshots/claude-code-android-3.jpg)

**Live demonstration** showing Claude Code (v2.0.22) with Claude Haiku 4.5 AI integration running in Termux environment on actual Android hardware. These aren't mockups - this is daily-driver tooling working perfectly on mobile.

## Reaching Anthropic

This repository is designed to demonstrate:

1. **Real-world demand** for Claude Code on mobile
2. **Functional proof** that it can work
3. **Community interest** and engagement
4. **Known limitations** that need official attention

We're not asking for perfection — we're showing the market opportunity and specific gaps that Anthropic could address.

**Issues to watch in the Anthropic repo:**
- [#9435 - Custom Slash Commands on Termux](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/9435)
- [#2248 - WebAssembly/Image support for Android](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/2248)

## The Ask to Anthropic 👋

Dear Anthropic team,

Developers want to use Claude Code on their phones. This repository proves:

1. **It's technically possible** ✅
2. **People want it badly** (6+ GitHub issues, community guides)
3. **Specific gaps are known** (documented with issue links)
4. **A working implementation exists** (this repo)

**What would help:**
- Official Termux support (at least to fix known issues)
- Better documentation of mobile limitations
- Prioritize #9435 and #2248
- Acknowledge the mobile developer market

We're not asking for full feature parity. We're asking you to **acknowledge the use case and help close the gaps**.

Thank you,
**The Community**
